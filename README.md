# Bi-Directional Attention Flow

This repo contains a notebook to illustrate the usage of the [BiDAF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01603) model.

We use the pre-trained model from [allennlp](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp) library and build some helper functions to visualize the attention weights
between a question and a text passage from where knowledge is extracted.

# Requirements

allennlp==0.7.0
numpy==1.15.2
matplotlib==3.0.0
